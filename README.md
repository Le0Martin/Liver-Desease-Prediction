# Predictive Analysis of Liver Disease Based on Biochemical Markers: A Case Study from Northeast Andhra Pradesh, India

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the probability of patients developing liver disease based on a series of clinical characteristics. Using supervised learning techniques for classification, various algorithms are tested to identify the most effective one. The final model could assist doctors, hospitals, and governments in planning health budgets and formulating preventive policies.
